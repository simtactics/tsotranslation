Welcome to the TSO Translation Project maintained by [SimTactics](https://github.com/simtactics) team and Sims Online community. To contribute, make sure you have The Sims Online installed, then download [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/), [CLI](https://cli.github.com/) or an editor, such as [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), that supports Git, finally fork this repository.
